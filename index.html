              <p class="paragraph-images">In my third year of school, I visited many european countries while my semester abroad in Berlin.
                One weekend, my good friend and I went to Belgium to meet up with other friends who were also abroad. We got terribly
                lost trying to find our airbnb, but somehow we finally made it. By train, we took a day trip to Bruges that Sunday.
                I fell in love with the humbleness and decorative nature of the city. It was an awesome visit.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-images">Ireland was my first stop before heading to Berlin for the semester. My friends
              and I all took the flight over together, over-paid for a cab to our hostel, and jumped on a full city tourâ€” all
              without sleeping a wink. This photo was taken on that tour our first day.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-images">Over the spring, I visited one of my good friends in San Francisco.
              Our first day there, it was overcast. We tried to see the Bay Bridge, but couldn't
              see through the fog. So, we decided to take the drive North and see the Point Reyes Lighthouse. It was
              such a trip to get out there through all the bends and turns of the mountains. I'm used to flat land so
              mountains behind every highway, house or mall was something I'll never forget.

              The charm of the hanging flowers over every building was so infectious. It was
              August when we were there, but with the Irish weather we were in jeans and spring sweaters.
              The sun makes it seem so much warmer. </p>

              forget when we drove through the winding roads of all those mountains to get their house.
              It was just like one of those car commercials, but real. If the drive was all we were going to do,
              I would have been satisfied. But, thankfully we were able to do some other activities and ended up
              climbing Mt. Errigal. The photo is at the top.</p>
